# DEBUG mode
#  This option specifies a debug option.
#  These options are not normally needed.
#  The number following -d selects the debug
#  option to enable as follows:
#  OPT   Description
#  ---    -----------------
#  0  - Ignore other SM nodes.
#  1  - Force single threaded dispatching.
#  2  - Force log flushing after each log message.
#  3  - Disable multicast support.
#  4  - Put OpenSM in memory tracking mode.
#  10.. Put OpenSM in testability mode.
#  none, no debug options are enabled.
DEBUG=none

# LMC          
#  This option specifies the subnet's LMC value.
#  The number of LIDs assigned to each port is 2^LMC.
#  The LMC value must be in the range 0-7.
#  LMC values > 0 allow multiple paths between ports.
#  LMC values > 0 should only be used if the subnet
#  topology actually provides multiple paths between
#  ports, i.e. multiple interconnects between switches.
#  OpenSM defaults to LMC = 0, which allows
#  one path between any two ports.
LMC=0

# MAXSMPS
#  This option specifies the number of VL15 SMP MADs
#  allowed on the wire at any one time.
#  Specifying -maxsmps 0 allows unlimited outstanding SMPs.
#  Without -maxsmps, OpenSM defaults to a maximum of
#  one outstanding SMP.
MAXSMPS=0

# REASSIGN_LIDS
#  This option causes OpenSM to reassign LIDs to all
#  end nodes. Specifying "REASSIGN_LIDS=yes" on a running subnet
#  may disrupt subnet traffic.
#  With "REASSIGN_LIDS=no", OpenSM attempts to preserve existing
#  LID assignments resolving multiple use of same LID.
REASSIGN_LIDS="no"

# SWEEP
#  This option specifies the number of seconds between
#  subnet sweeps.  Specifying SWEEP=0 disables sweeping.
#  OpenSM defaults to a sweep interval of 10 seconds.
SWEEP=10

# TIMEOUT
#  This option specifies the time in milliseconds
#  used for transaction timeouts.
#  Specifying -t 0 disables timeouts.
#  Without -t, OpenSM defaults to a timeout value of
#  100 milliseconds.
TIMEOUT=200


# OSM_LOG
#  This option defines the log to be the given file.
#  By default the log goes to /tmp/osm.log.
#  For the log to go to standard output use OSM_LOG=stdout.
OSM_LOG=/tmp/osm.log                                                                         

# VERBOSE
#  This option increases the log verbosity level.
#  The "-v" option may be specified multiple times
#  to further increase the verbosity level.
#   "-V" option sets the maximum verbosity level and
#   forces log flushing.
#   The "-V" is equivalent to "-vf 0xFF -d 2".
VERBOSE="none"

# UPDN
#  This option activate UPDN algorithm instead of Min Hop
#  algorithm (default).
#  To switch on UPDN algorithm set UPDN="on"
UPDN="off"


# GUID_FILE
#  This option only allowed when UPDN algorithm is activated
#  It specifies the guid list file from which to fetch the guid list
#  The file contain in each line only one valid guid
GUID_FILE="none"

#  This option specifies the local port GUID value
#  with which OpenSM should bind.  OpenSM may be
#  bound to 1 port at a time.
#  If GUID given is 0, opensmd use PORT_NUM parameter.
#  Without -g (GUID="none"), OpenSM trys to use the default port.
GUID=0

# OSM_HOSTS
#  The list of all SM's IP addresses in InfiniBand subnet
#  Used to handover mechanism
OSM_HOSTS=""

# OSM_CACHE_DIR
OSM_CACHE_DIR=/var/cache/osm

# CACHE_OPTIONS
#  Cache the given command line options into the file
#  /var/cache/osm/opensm.opts for use next invocation
#  The cache directory can be changed by the environment
#  variable OSM_CACHE_DIR
#  Set to '--cache-options' or '-c' in order to enable
CACHE_OPTIONS="none"

# HONORE_GUID2LID 
#  This option forces OpenSM to honor the guid2lid file,
#  when it comes out of Standby state, if such file exists
#  under OSM_CACHE_DIR, and is valid.
#  Set to '--honor_guid2lid' or '-x' to enable.
#  By default this is FALSE. Will be set automatically to '--honor_guid2lid'
#  if OSM_HOSTS includes list of more then one IP addresses.
HONORE_GUID2LID="none"

# RCP
#  This option osed by SLDD daemon for handover mechanism
#  to copy local cache file to remote computer
RCP=/usr/bin/scp

# RSH
#  This option osed by SLDD daemon for handover mechanism
#  to execute commands on remote computer
RSH=/usr/bin/ssh

# RESCAN_TIME
#  This option osed by SLDD daemon for handover mechanism
#  Time between sweep of sldd daemon in seconds
RESCAN_TIME=60

# PORT_NUM
#  This option defines HCA's port number which OpenSM should bind
PORT_NUM=1

# ONBOOT
#  To start OpenSM automatically set ONBOOT=yes
ONBOOT=no
