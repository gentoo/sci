The FInite element Automatic Tabulator FIAT supports generation of
arbitrary order instances of the Lagrange elements on lines, triangles,
and tetrahedra. It is also capable of generating arbitrary order
instances of Jacobi-type quadrature rules on the same element shapes.
Further, H(div) and H(curl) conforming finite element spaces such as the
families of Raviart-Thomas, Brezzi-Douglas-Marini and Nedelec are
supported on triangles and tetrahedra. Upcoming versions will also
support Hermite and nonconforming elements.
