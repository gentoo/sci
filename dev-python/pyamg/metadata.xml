AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with optimal or near-optimal efficiency. Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix. This feature is especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes and irregular grids.
PyAMG features implementations of:
 * Ruge-Stuben (RS) or Classical AMG
 * AMG based on Smoothed Aggregation (SA)
and experimental support for:
 * Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation (αSA)
 * Compatible Relaxation (CR)
The predominant portion of PyAMG is written in Python with a smaller amount of supporting C++ code for performance critical operations.
