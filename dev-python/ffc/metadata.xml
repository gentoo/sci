		FFC works as a compiler for multilinear forms by generating code (C or
		C++) for the evaluation of a multilinear form given in mathematical
		notation. This new approach to form evaluation makes it possible to
		combine generality with efficiency; the form can be given in
		mathematical notation and the generated code is as efficient as
		hand-optimized code.
