		PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on
		PyQt4/PySide and numpy. It is intended for use in mathematics /
		scientific / engineering applications. Despite being written entirely
		in python, the library is very fast due to its heavy leverage of numpy
		for number crunching and Qt's GraphicsView framework for fast display.
		PyQtGraph is distributed under the MIT open-source license.
