MeshPy offers quality triangular and tetrahedral mesh generation for Python. 
Meshes of this type are chiefly used in finite-element simulation codes, but 
also have many other applications ranging from computer graphics to robotics.
In order to generate these 2D and 3D meshes, MeshPy provides Python interfaces 
to two well-regarded mesh generators, Triangle by J. Shewchuk and TetGen by 
Hang Si. Both are included in the package in slightly modified versions.
