  Astronomical Tables in Python (ATpy) is a high-level package
  providing a way to manipulate tables of astronomical data in a
  uniform way. A table is defined by any number  of columns of data,
  each characterized by a column name, unit, null value, and
  description (the last three being optional), and can be supplemented
  with metadata in the form of keywords or comments. ATpy can be used
  to manipulate single tables as well as sets of tables. Table formats
  supported are FITS, VO, IPAC. Database supported are SQLite, MySQL
  and PostgreSQL.
