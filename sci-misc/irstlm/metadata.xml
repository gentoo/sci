	The IRST Language Modeling Toolkit features algorithms
	and data structures suitable to estimate, store, and access very large LMs.
	The software has been integrated into a popular open source Statistical Machine
	Translation decoder called Moses, and is compatible with language models created
	with other tools, such as the SRILM Tooolkit.
