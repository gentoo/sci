Asymptote is a powerful descriptive vector graphics language
that provides a natural coordinate-based framework for technical drawing.
Labels and equations are typeset with LaTeX,
for high-quality PostScript output.
A major advantage of Asymptote over other graphics packages
is that it is a programming language,
as opposed to just a graphics program.
