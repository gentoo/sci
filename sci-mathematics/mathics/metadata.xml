		Mathics—to be pronounced like “Mathematics” without the “emat”—is a general-purpose computer algebra system (CAS).
		It is meant to be a free, light-weight alternative to Mathematica®. It is free both as in “free beer” and as in “freedom”.
		There are various online mirrors running Mathics but it is also possible to run Mathics locally. A list of mirrors
		can be found at the Mathics homepage, http://mathics.github.io.

		The programming language of Mathics is meant to resemble Wolfram's famous Mathematica® as much as possible.
		However, Mathics is in no way affiliated or supported by Wolfram. Mathics will probably never have the power to
		compete with Mathematica® in industrial applications; yet, it might be an interesting alternative for educational purposes.
