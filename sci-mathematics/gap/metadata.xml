  Groups, Algorithms, Programming is a system for computational
  discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group
  Theory. GAP provides a  programming language, a library of thousands
  of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
  language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP
  is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their
  representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial
  structures, and more.
