Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome of
interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can be
easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher
to analyse the methylation levels of their samples straight away. It's main
features are: (1) Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step;
(2) Supports single-end and paired-end read alignments; (3) Supports ungapped
and gapped alignments; (4) Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are
adjustable; (5) Output discriminates between cytosine methylation in CpG, CHG
and CHH context.
