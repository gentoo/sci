  Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
  technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other
  technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler,
  distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive
  mathematical function library. The library, mostly written in Julia itself,
  also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear
  algebra, random number generation, FFTs, and string processing. More
  libraries continue to be added over time. Julia programs are organized
  around defining functions, and overloading them for different combinations
  of argument types (which can also be user-defined).
