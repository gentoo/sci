	APFEL++ is a C++ rewriting of the Fortran 77 evolution code APFEL. However, APFEL++ is based on a completely new code design and guarantees a better performance along with a more optimal memory management. The new modular structure allows for better maintainability and easier extensibility. This makes APFEL++ suitable for a wide range of tasks: from the solution of the DGLAP evolution equations to the computation of deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) and single-inclusive-annihilation cross sections. Also more complex computations, such as differential semi-inclusive DIS and Drell-Yan cross sections, are easily implementable in APFEL++.
