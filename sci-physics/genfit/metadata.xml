  GENFIT is an experiment-independent framework for track reconstruction for
  particle and nuclear physics. It consists of three modular components:
  - Track fitting algorithms
    Currently, GENFIT contains a Kalman Filter and a
    Deterministic Annealing Filter. 
    Other algorithm modules can be added easily.
  - Track representations
    These modules hold the data of track track parameters and can perform
    extrapolations of these parameters. 
    GENFIT is distributed with two well-tested track representations.
    Existing track extrapolation codes can be interfaced in a very
    straightforward way in this framework, using their native geometry
    and magnetic field interfaces.
  - Reconstruction hits
    The hit dimensionality and the orientation of planar tracking detectors
    can be chosen freely. 
  GENFIT is especially useful for tracking systems which include detectors
  which do not measure the passage of particles on predefined planes,
  like TPCs or wire-based drift chambers. The concept of so-called
  virtual detector planes provides a simple mechanism to use these
  detector hits in a transparent way without any geometrical simplifications.
  GENFIT has been developed in the framework of the PANDA experiment at
  FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany. 
  It is also used in the Belle-2, Fopi, and GEM-TPC experiments.
