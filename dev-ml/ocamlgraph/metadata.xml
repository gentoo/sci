		It provides an easy-to-use graph data structure together with several
		operations and algorithms over graphs, in Graph.Pack. It is a reasonably
		efficient imperative data structure for directed graphs with vertices
		and edges labeled with integers. Several other graph implementations
		are proposed for those not satisfied with the one above. Some are
		persistent (imutable) and other imperative  (mutable). Some are directed
		and other are not. Some have labels for vertices, or labels for edges,
		or both. Some have abstract types for vertices. etc. These
		implementations are written as functors: you give the types of vertices
		labels, edge labels, etc. and you get the data structure as a result.
		it also provides several classic operations and algorithms over graphs.
		They are also written as functors i.e. independently of the data
		structure for graphs. One consequence is that you can define your own
		data structure for graphs and yet re-use all the algorithms from this
		library: you only need to provide a few operations such as iterating
		over all vertices, over the successors of a vertex, etc.
