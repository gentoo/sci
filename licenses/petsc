   For version 3.0.0 and earlier of PETSc If you modify PETSc source code and
   wish to distributed only binary versions of your changed code (which you
   can) you must config/configure.py PETSc with the additional flag
   --with-gnu-copyright-code=0 to prevent violating the GNU copyright which
   covers a tiny percentage of the code in the PETSc distribution. For
   versions later than 3.0.0 this issue does not exist.
