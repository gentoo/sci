	Nipype, an open-source, community-developed initiative under the
	umbrella of NiPy, is a Python project that provides a uniform interface
	to existing neuroimaging software and facilitates interaction between
	these packages within a single workflow. Nipype provides an environment
	that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms from different
	packages (e.g., SPM, FSL, FreeSurfer, Camino, MRtrix, MNE, AFNI, Slicer),
	eases the design of workflows within and between packages, and reduces
	the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype is
	creating a collaborative platform for neuroimaging software development
	in a high-level language and addressing limitations of existing pipeline systems.
