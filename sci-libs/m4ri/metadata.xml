	<longdescription>M4RI is a library for fast arithmetic with dense matrices over F2. The name M4RI comes from the first implemented algorithm: The 'Method of the Four Russians' inversion algorithm published by Gregory Bard. This algorithm in turn is named after the 'Method of the Four Russians' multiplication algorithm which is probably better referred to as Kronrod's method.</longdescription>
