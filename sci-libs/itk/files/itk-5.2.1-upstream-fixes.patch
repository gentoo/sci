Subject: [PATCH] COMP: CastXML, ITKVtkGlue, include only when property exists

Some targets (VTK libraries) didn't have the property INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES

```bash
CMake Error in Modules/Bridge/VtkGlue/wrapping/CMakeLists.txt:
  Found relative path while evaluating include directories of
  "ITKVtkGluePython":

```

Triggered when compiling Slicer with `Slicer_BUILD_ITKPython:BOOL=ON`
aka `ITK_WRAP_PYTHON:BOOL=ON`.

Full error log with extra printing:
