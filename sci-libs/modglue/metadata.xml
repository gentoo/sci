The libModglue library is a C++ library with classes for forking external
processes and asynchronous reading from streams. It takes away the burden of all
subtleties involving the Unix fork call. The asynchronous read facility enables
one to read on multiple input streams at the same time, without loosing any of
the standard C++ stream facilities. There are also several small additional
programs bundled with modglue, such as a program to add readline capability
to any command line program. Moreover, the modglue library extends the idea of
standard Unix pipes by providing a general framework for the creation of new
processes with more than just the standard stdin/stdout/stderr pipes.
