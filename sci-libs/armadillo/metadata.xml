  Armadillo is a C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming
  towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
  floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a
  subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix
  decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK
  and ATLAS libraries. 
  A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to
  combine several operations into one and reduce (or eliminate) the
  need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive
  templates and template meta-programming.
