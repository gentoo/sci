  LAPACK++ (Linear Algebra PACKage in C++) is a software library for
  numerical linear algebra that solves systems of linear equations and
  eigenvalue problems on high performance computer architectures.
  Computational support is provided for supports various matrix classes
  for vectors, non-symmetric matrices, SPD matrices, symmetric matrices,
  banded, triangular, and tridiagonal matrices; however, it does not
  include all of the capabilities of original f77 LAPACK. Emphasis is
  given to routines for solving linear systems consisting of non-symmetric
  matrices, symmetric positive definite systems, and solving linear
  least-square systems.
