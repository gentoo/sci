Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source hardware
accelerated multiphysics simulation platform (and an extensible general
purpose tool for solving Partial Differential Equations). Its
computational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free
solution techniques which enable extraordinarily high performance,
memory efficiency and deployability on a variety of massively parallel
architectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to
heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely
behind simple C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from
application programmers. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows to
move from CAD directly to simulation drastically reducing pre-processing
efforts and amount of potential errors. ASL can be used to model various
coupled physical and chemical phenomena and employed in a multitude of
fields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual sensing, industrial
process data validation and reconciliation, image-guided surgery,
computer-aided engineering, design space exploration, crystallography,
etc.
