<p>
  There are <uri link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numerical_libraries">many</uri>
  performant numerical libraries available. 
  The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and the Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK)
  are well designed linear algebra libraries developed by the
  High Performance Computing (HPC) community. BLAS is an API of dense
  matrix and vectors products, while LAPACK provides routines for
  solving systems of linear equations. Both are widely used in
  many scientific applications and it is, therefore, important to 
  have efficient implementations available.
</p>

<p>
  BLAS and LAPACK were originally written in FORTRAN 77. Since then, a
  number of additional language wrappers have been developed for
  languages like C, C++, FORTRAN 95, Java, Python, etc...
  Netlib offers exact implementations of the APIs and they are called
  "reference" libraries.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition, Gentoo provides a number of optimized implementations
  of the above linear algebra libraries that will be described
  below. You can switch between implementations with the
  Gentoo's <c>eselect</c> system and the widely used <c>pkg-config</c>
  tool.
</p>

<p>
  It is important to note that if you require, e.g., a well performing 
  BLAS implementation, simply emerging X over Y often is not enough. Rather, you will have
  to carefully benchmark your applications since performance may depend 
  on many factors,
  such as hardware or network.
  If you are simply looking for a well performing and well tested
  implementation, the reference ebuilds will likely be your best choice.

<title>For Users</title>
<section>
<title>Installing</title>
<body>

<p>
  If best possible performance is not of paramount importance for you 
  and you simply need BLAS and/or LAPACK, just emerge the virtual
  package:
</p>

<pre caption="Installing">
# <i>emerge lapack</i>
</pre>

<p>
  This will install both <><> and <><> the reference packages from
  <uri>http://www.netlib.org/</uri> . They are well tested, easy to debug
  implementations. They should satisfy most users; if they're all you need, you're
  done reading.
</p>

<p>
However, if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>linear algebra libraries are critical for the speed of your applications</li>
  <li>you absolutely need to build the fastest computer</li>
  <li>you want to help Gentoo sci project to improve their packages</li>
</ul>

<p>
... then read on, and be sure to file bugs both to Gentoo and upstream.
</p>

<p>
  There is a number of optimized implementations of these libraries in the Portage
  tree:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
   <uri link="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net">ATLAS</uri>: Automatically
   Tuned Linear Algebra Software is an open-source package that empirically
   tunes the library to the machine it is being compiled on. It provides BLAS
   (FORTRAN 77 and C), and LAPACK implementations on various architectures.
  </li>
  <li>
   <uri
   link="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2/">GotoBLAS</uri>:
   Goto BLAS provides open-source, free for academic use, hand-coded
   machine language, processor optimized versions of the FORTRAN 77
   and C BLAS routines. Still claims to be the fastest BLAS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <uri link="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl/">MKL</uri>:
    Intel® Math Kernel Library is a closed-source but free package for
    non-commercial use on Linux systems containing implementations of all the linear
    algebra libraries mentioned here.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Usually performance gain is noticeable mainly with BLAS, since LAPACK routines
  depend on BLAS kernels.

<title>Developping with the installed linear algebra libraries</title>
<body>

<p>
  We took great care to make sure that each package provides
  consistent pkg-config files generated by us.
  Compiling and linking becomes straightforward:
</p>

<pre caption="Compiling and linking linear algebra libraries">
# <i>pkg-config --libs blas</i>    <comment>(To link with FORTRAN 77 BLAS library)</comment>
# <i>pkg-config --cflags cblas</i> <comment>(To compile against C BLAS library)</comment>
# <i>pkg-config --libs cblas</i>   <comment>(To link with C BLAS library)</comment>
# <i>pkg-config --libs scalapack</i>  <comment>(To link with the ScaLAPACK library)</comment>
</pre>

<p>
  <c>pkg-config</c> files are available for all implementations and
  various alternatives within implementations. The default names of
  the implementations are: blas, cblas, lapack, lapacke, blacs and
  scalapack, and they can be chosen with <c>eselect</c>. You can also always compile or link
  with an library not selected for the 
  More information on using <c>pkg-config</c> can be obtained with <c>man pkg-config</c>. 
</p>

</section>
<section>
<title>Selecting libraries</title>
<body>

<p>
  You can switch BLAS, CBLAS and LAPACK implementations with
  <c>eselect</c>. you can view which implementations of CBLAS
  are available.
</p>

<pre caption="Viewing available implementations of CBLAS">
# <i>eselect cblas list</i>
Installed CBLAS for library directory lib64
[1]   atlas
[2]   atlas-threads
[3]   gsl
[4]   mkl-threads *
[5]   reference
</pre>

<p>
  The implementation marked with an asterisk (*) is the currently
  selected implementation. To switch implementations, run:
</p>

<pre caption="Switching to the threaded ATLAS implementation of BLAS">
# <i>eselect blas set atlas-threads</i>
</pre>

<p>
  To learn more about the <c>eselect</c> tool, visit the 
  <uri link="http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/eselect/user-guide.xml">eselect guide</uri>
</p>

<p>
  When selecting your linear algebra profiles try to avoid mixing
  different implementations since we don't have any mechanism to enforce
  reasonable profiles. However, here is a list of well performing
  profile combinations that have been used successfully in the past:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> performant on most CPUs:
    <ul>
      <li>blas, cblas: atlas (or atlas-threads with multi-processor)</li>
      <li>lapack, lapacke: atlas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> performant on most CPUs:
    <ul>
      <li>blas, cblas: goto2 </li>
      <li>lapack, lapacke: reference</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> performant on AMD based CPUs:
    <ul>
      <li>cblas: reference</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> performant on Intel based CPUs:
    <ul>
      <li>blas,cblas,lapack: mkl-threads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<title>Choosing a compiler</title>
<body>

<p>
  All the above libraries have been tested with the GNU compiler
  collections (gcc, gfortran).
  There are many available C compilers and a few FORTRAN (ifort,
  Open64) compilers on Gentoo and many other FORTRAN compilers outside
  of Gentoo ().
</p>

<pre caption="Installing BLAS with the Intel FORTRAN compiler">
# <i>F77=ifort FFLAGS="-O2 -mp1" emerge blas-reference</i>
</pre>

<p>
  Depending on your hardware, a small performance gain can be noticed thanks to
  vectorization. The <c>-mp</c> flag maintains floating-point precision, since by
  default ifort is pretty aggressive on floating point arithmetic, and we are
  actually compiling a math package. Try <c>man ifort</c> to see additional flags
  to fit your hardware.
</p>

<p>
  Some of the implementations let you specify the Intel® C compiler as
  well. Please beware that not all libraries compile with all
  combinations.  You should receive an error during the emerge in case you have
  chosen an incompatible combination.
</p>

<p>
  As usual for Gentoo, there are many combinations of USE flags and
  compilers with which you could compile a package. Unfortunately
  switching compilers between BLAS and LAPACK might not be always
  compatible. For example: 
</p>

<pre caption="Looking for trouble combinations">
# <i>FC=gfortran FFLAGS="-O2" emerge lapack-reference</i>
</pre>

<p>
  This will most likely break things or not even compile.
</p>

<p>
  Try to be consistent in your choice. Stay with the GCC most of the time will
  avoid you some trouble, unless you want to use the MKL, in which case the Intel
  compilers make a good combination.
</p>

</body>
</section>
<section>
<title>Documentation</title>
<body>

<p>
  If you need BLAS or LAPACK to develop your own programs, the documentation
  becomes pretty handy. Setting the USE="doc" flag for the corresponding BLAS or
  LAPACK package will install man pages and quick reference sheets from the
  <c>app-doc/blas-docs</c> and <c>app-doc/lapack-docs</c> packages. They are
  standard and valid for all implementations. For optimized packages, the
  USE="doc" flags will usually install extra doc in PDF or HTML format.

<title>Packages with BLAS/LAPACK dependencies</title>
<body>

<p>
  You need two things:
  set [R]DEPEND to <c>virtual/<imp></c>. To build some
  packages, you m need to use the pkg-config tool. If you are lucky, the
  package uses autotools together with the autoconf <>AX_BLAS and <>AX_LAPACK M4
  macros. In this case, the configuration step becomes simple. For example:
</p>

<pre caption="Sample package configuration with autotools">
<keyword>econf</keyword> --with-blas="<var>$(pkg-config --libs blas)</var>"
</pre>

</section>



<title>Providing new implementations</title>
<body>

<p>
  The Portage tree contains many ebuilds that depend on the
  BLAS/CBLAS/LAPACK/BLACS/ScaLAPACK libraries. As there is more than
  one possible implementation, the Gentoo Science Project
  reorganized all the packages to provide <c>virtual</c>. All ebuilds using
  should depend on this virtual package, unless it is explicitly
  known to break with a specific implementation.
</p>

<p>
  To work with Gentoo's configuration tools
  <c>app-admin/eselect-{blas,cblas,lapack}</c>, and the virtual, every ebuild that
  installs a BLAS implementation must fulfill following requirements:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
  The ebuild must install an eselect file for each profile it provides. The
  libraries should link to the ones in <path>/usr/$(get_libdir)</path>
  directories and the include files in <path>/usr/include</path>:
 <ul>
      <li>
	<path>libblas.so[.0]</path> - Shared object for FORTRAN BLAS
	applications
      </li>
      <li>
        <path>libblas.a</path> - Static library for FORTRAN BLAS applications
      </li>
      <li>
        <path>libcblas.so[.0]</path> - Shared object for C/C++ CBLAS applications
      </li>
      <li>
        <path>libcblas.a</path> - Static library for C/C++ CBLAS applications
      </li>
      <li><path>cblas.h</path> - Include header for C/C++ applications</li>
      <li>
        <path>liblapack.so[.0]</path> - Shared object for FORTRAN LAPACK
	applications
      </li>
      <li>
        <path>liblapack.a</path> - Static library for FORTRAN LAPACK applications
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The ebuild must install a <path>blas.pc</path>, <path>cblas.pc</path> and/or
    <path>lapack.pc</path> pkg-config file and therefore RDEPEND on
    <c>dev-util/pkgconfig</c>.  They should also be included in the eselect
    files, and link to the <path>/usr/$(get_libdir)/pkgconfig</path> directory:
    <ul>
      <li><path>blas.pc</path> - BLAS pkg-config file</li>
      <li><path>cblas.pc</path> - CBLAS pkg-config file</li>
      <li><path>lapack.pc</path> - LAPACK pkg-config file</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Be included in the virtual package as a possible provider:
    <ul>
      <li><c>virtual/blas</c> - BLAS virtual package</li>
      <li><c>virtual/cblas</c> - CBLAS virtual package</li>
      <li><c>virtual/lapack</c> - LAPACK virtual package</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
 
<p>
  The easiest way of understanding all this is probably getting inspiration from
  one of the available packages. Currently the Portage tree provide the following
  virtual packages:
