TAPPY is a tidal analysis package. It breaks down a record of water levels into
the component sine waves. It is written in Python and uses the least squares
optimization and other functions in SciPy. The focus is to make the most
accurate analysis possible. TAPPY only determines the constituents that are
calculatable according to the length of the time series.
